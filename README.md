  ## Description:
  ***
  The motivation behind this project was to create an application that generates a high-quality README.md quickly and easily. <br /><br />  This is a command-line application based on a userâ€™s input. The user is prompted using the Inquirer npm package and initiated by running NodeJS. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to add more licenses options/badges, a GitHub API call to confirm the username inputted is a profile, and then populate the Questions section with a profile image and more user info.
